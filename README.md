# typescript-maeth1

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/typescript-maeth1)

Design considerations:

All we need for the scope of this project is typescript and jasmine.
Whenever I choose to use any technology, I do not consider my personal preference or my background, I look at the needs of the project, because this decision may impact it greatly in a few years time, when technology evolves.

The structure is based on the MVC pattern and follows the interface naming convention from Angular.

Testing is aimed at coverage and functionality sanity checks.
Manual testing is required, where more edge cases will be uncovered and unit tests should them, to ensure against regression.
